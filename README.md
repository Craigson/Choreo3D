# Choreo3D

   Choreo3D began as a product of the Choreographic Coding Lab, a project of The Motion Bank,
   at the New York workshop in August 2014.  The software uses raw data captured from a Vicon
   Motion capture system in JSON format.  The data is parsed and the visualisation can be
   controlled using the GUI.  The end goal for the project is to allow the user to manipulate
   the data during playback and allow them to create new and dynamic performances and pieces
   of choreography.
